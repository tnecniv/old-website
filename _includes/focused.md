I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [ACDS](https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/) Lab at Georgia Tech, supervised by Evangelos Theodorou, where I work at the intersection of robotics, generative AI, and optimal control.

I conducted my PhD work at Princeton as part of the [IRoM](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu) Lab at Princeton where I was advised by Anirudha Majumdar.
