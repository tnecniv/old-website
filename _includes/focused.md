I am a PhD candidate at Princeton University advised by Anirudha Majumdar as part of the [Intelligent Robot Motion IRoM](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu) (IRoM) Lab.

My work is on understanding necessary and sufficient amounts of task-relevant information needed to build a performant robot, both theoretically and experimentally.

Broadly, my interests are in topics involving dynamics and **control**, **optimization**, and connections between problems in **robotics and natural sciences**.
