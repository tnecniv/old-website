I am a postdoctoral fellow in the [ACDS](https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/) Lab at Georgia Tech, supervised by Evangelos Theodorou, where I work at the intersection of robotics, generative AI, and optimal control. My current work involves quantifying and improving the generalization capabilities of AI models, such as generative diffusion models and deep unfolded algorithms, using optimal control principles.

I conducted my PhD work at Princeton as part of the [IRoM](https://irom-lab.princeton.edu) Lab at Princeton where I was advised by Anirudha Majumdar.
